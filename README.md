# Project name: OOP

## Project mission
Freshshop is your new customer. They specialize in organic food and biodegradable bikes. Their store in Saint-Gilles is so profitable that they've opened another just below Thomas's apartment. To celebrate, they want to launch an e-commerce website at the same time.

Freshshop already owns the frontend part of the project. You must now implement the back-end with NodeJS or Php in OOP.
